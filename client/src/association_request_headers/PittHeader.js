                If you need support or have resources to offer as we navigate the COVID-19 crisis as a community, 
                please use this form. Your responses to this form will only be seen by a team of volunteers working 
                to match resources with needs. You can find more public resources at <a href="www.pittsburghmutualaid.com" target="_blank">www.pittsburghmutualaid.com</a>.

                We are prioritizing folks who are sick, disabled, quarantined without pay, elderly, undocumented, 
                queer, Black, Indigenous, and/or people of color -- including those displaced from Pittsburgh to the nearby areas.

                This form is being managed by a group of all-volunteer Pittsburgh community members involved in local organizing efforts.
